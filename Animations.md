# Animations

### Intro
* Already had a base css and html project to start with
  * Index.html has the jQuery script
* Our code changes will go inside script.js

Fade In, Fade Out and Fade To
  * Fade Out sets the element to have css style of "display: none"
  * All other elements adjust such that the faded out element never existed on the layout
  * fadeTo with 0 opacity leaves the element on the layout, but just makes it invisible
